                        Whether you enroll in a Bachelor's or a Master's degree in Computer Science, you want to be a top student and prove that you have advanced your computing skills. Regardless of your specialization, Computer Science degrees are challenging, even if you
                        are a tech fanatic and passionate about Computer Science. So how should you deal with all the work and information that you procure throughout a single day? Here are some basic tips and tricks to keep in mind if you want to be
                        a successful Computer Science student, if not, the best in your class:
                        <li>1. Don't expect to learn everything during lectures </li>
                        <li>2. Studying the night before an exam will NOT work</li>
                        <li>3. Focus on developing your practical Computer Science skills</li>
                        <li>4. Don't be a lone wolf</li>
                        <li>5. Remember:You still have a life</li>

                        As we approach the time for college classes to kick off again. Whether your school is offline or in-person, there is a handful of things you can do to make this year a success. This article is a collection of tips for computer science majors to help them
                        hava successful year. This information has been curated over my three years of studying at university, along iwth various advice from other students and professors.
                        <li>1. You Need a Personal Website</li>
                        <li>2. Complete projects and labs early - This helps to develop a pattern and as you develop that pattern instead of waiting until last minute to start the projects you would have already been on the way to completeing them.</li>
                        <li>3. Learn the difference between the three different types of Computer Science courses - There are Algorithm courses (for example: discrete math, data structures), Hardware/low level courses( for example: operating systems, computer
                            networks, computer architecture) and Programming courses( for example: software analysis and design, software engineering). All of these classes are important but don't load up your schedule with too many of one type of class
                            in the same semester or you mught get overwhelmed with too much of the same type of workload. This depends on the specific class, but it's generally a good rule to follow.</li>
